# Replication of vulnerability management in Linux distributions

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all the following prerequisites on your machine:
- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Python 3.8+ - [Download & Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Make - Download & Install make, .e.g., [OSX](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), [Linux](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO-3.html)

We recommend using an [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) environment with Python version 3.8, and every Python requirement should be met.

## Introduction 

To run the scripts, using the following command to install the required Python modules. If you cannot run the command, please find the required modules from the `supplementerial/requirements.txt` file and install them manually.
```
$ make install
```

Download data. Note that this process takes a long time. Make sure your machine has a stable network connection and a power supply.


Download CVE records. 
```
$ make download_cve
```

Download Fedora's bugs, vulnerability reports, and advisories. 
```
$ make fedora
```

Download Debian's bugs, vulnerability reports, and advisories. Note that you might encounter Debian's SSL certificate problem while downloading vulnerability reports. Check [Debian support](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Support).
```
$ make debian
```
